Initial stages of an iOS app for [DialTest](https://github.com/travisvalentine/DialTest)

Instead of a slider (which was the initial implementation), the app now uses CoreMotion's Device Motion to use the app's movement to move the dial per se. A static image demonstrating the layout is below. Since CoreMotion doesn't show up in the simulator, I can't include a video.
